//2) public    = The public keyword is used in the declaration of a class, method, or field; 
//               public classes, methods, and fields can be accessed by the members of any class

//3) protected = The protected keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class;

//               if no case matches the specified value
//               Alternatively, the default keyword can also be used to declare default values in a Java annotation. 
//               From Java 8 onwards, the default keyword can be used to allow an interface to provide an implementation of a method.	
	
//return      =  Used to finish the execution of a method. 
//               It can be followed by a value required by the method definition that is returned to the caller
