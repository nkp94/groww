//     for   = The for keyword is used to create a for loop, 
//             which specifies a variable initialization, a boolean expression, and an incrementation. 
//             The variable initialization is performed first, and then the boolean expression is evaluated. 
//             If the expression evaluates to true, the block of statements associated with the loop are executed, 
//             and then the incrementation is performed. 
//             The boolean expression is then evaluated again; this continues until the expression evaluates to false.
