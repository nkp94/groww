	//Having Two Types ---------------> 
	//(1) Upcasting  - [i]  Assigning sub class properties to super class is called as Upcasting
	//                 [ii] Before performing upcasting 1st we need to do Inheritance ,
	//                      After performing inheritance ,properties will comes from superclass to subclass
	//                [iii] In subclass we can declare new property
	//                      During upcasting we can print only those properties which are inherited from superclass
	//                 [iv] Newly added properties inside the subclass can't be printed
	//(2) Downcating - [i] Assigning superclass properties in subclass is called as downcasting
	//                 [ii] Before performing Downcasting 1st we need to perform Upcasting
	//        Note ---> If we do direct downcasting without performing in java we will get "Class_cast Exception"
