//Syntax of main 
//        public  static  void  main  (String [] args) {
	 // Access Specifier- Access Modifier- returntype - actual method name (Data Type- CMD line args-args)
	
//Que] Why main method is public ?
//----> To call JVM From anywhere since scope of public access specifier is throughout the project

//Que] Why main method is static ?
//---> Without creating object JVM can call main(-) since it is static

//Que] Why the return type of main is void ?
//---> Main(-) performs only functionality it will no return anything hence it's return type is void
	
//Que] Why it's name is main ??
//---> It is provided by Oracle software engineers inside the jvm libraries
